# BookChain

BookChain is an accounting library that provides a cryptographic audit trail of
every identity, ledger, account, transaction, and entry to ensure data
integrity. It also uses the tapescript package to ensure account security and
reject invalid transactions if controls are configured on the involved accounts.
Included are tools for establishing correspondent credit relations as well as
accomplishing basic bookkeeping tasks.

## Status

All initially planned features have been implemented and tested.

Open issues can be found [here](https://github.com/k98kurz/bookchain/issues).

The async implementation has an upstream issue from the sqloquent dependency
that can be tracked [here](https://github.com/k98kurz/sqloquent/issues/16). Once
that is fixed, the dependency will be updated, and this notice will be removed.

## Overview

This library provides an accounting system using sqloquent for persistence,
packify for deterministic encoding, tapescript for authorization, and the
classic rules of double-entry bookkeeping. All entries and transactions have
deterministic content IDs determined by hashing the relevant contents, and the
inclusion of tapescript allows for Bitcoin-style locking and unlocking scripts
to encode access controls at the account level.

### Class organization

`Currency` represents a currency/unit of account for a `Ledger`. It includes the
number of subunits to track and optionally the base for conversion to decimal
(defaults to 10), FX symbol, prefix symbol, and/or postfix symbol to be used with
the `format` method (e.g. `USD.format(1200)` could result in "12.00 USD",
"$12.00", or "12.00$", respectively). It also includes `to_decimal` method for
formatting int amounts into `Decimal`s.

`Identity` represents a legal person or other entity that can sign contracts
or engage in transactions. It includes the name, details, and optionally public
key bytes and private key seed bytes.

`Ledger` represents a general ledger for a given `Identity` using a specific
`Currency`. It includes a name, the `Identity` id, and the `Currency` id.

`Account` represents an account for a given `Ledger`. It includes a name, a type
(one of the `AccountType` enum options), the `Ledger` id, an optional locking
script for access control, and optional details.

`AccountType` is an enum representing the valid account types. The options are
`DEBIT_BALANCE`, `ASSET`, `CONTRA_ASSET`, `CREDIT_BALANCE`, `LIABILITY`,
`EQUITY`, `CONTRA_LIABILITY`, and `CONTRA_EQUITY`.

`Entry` represents an entry in the general ledger for a given `Account`. It
includes a type (one of the `EntryType` enum options), an amount, a nonce, the
`Account` id, and optional details.

`EntryType` is an enum representing the valid entry types. The options are
CREDIT and DEBIT.

`Transaction` represents a transaction made of `Entry`s. It includes the `Entry`
ids, `Ledger` ids, a timestamp, details, and the auth script(s). Each
`Transaction` must include entries that balance the number of credits and debits
applied to each ledger affected by the transaction. Use `Transaction.prepare` to
prepare a transaction -- it will raise validation errors if the transaction is
not valid -- then call `.save()` on the result to persist it to the database.
Transactions in the database can be validated by using `.validate()`, which will
return `True` if it is valid and `False` if it is not (it will also raise errors
in some situations that require more information about the validation failure).

`Correspondence` represents a correspondent credit relationship between several
`Identity`s.

- `Identity` has many `Ledger`s and is within `Correspondence`s
- `Ledger` belongs to `Identity` and `Currency`, has many `Account`s, and is within `Transaction`s
- `Account` belongs to `Ledger` and has many `Entry`s
- `Entry` belongs to `Account` and is within `Transaction`s
- `Transaction` contains `Ledger`s and `Entry`s
- `Correspondence` contains `Identity`s

### Cryptographic audit trail

Models inherit from `sqloquent.HashedModel`, so all data is hashed into the ID,
guaranteeing a unique, deterministic ID for each unique model.

Whenever something is deleted, it will be encoded and inserted into the
`deleted_models` table to maintain an audit trail.

Accounts may be created with locking scripts, which will require associated
Entries to provide valid auth scripts. These scripts are executed using
tapescript. If some tapescript runtime values are required for validation,
e.g. cache or plugins, they can be saved in Transaction.details and passed to
`Transaction.validate` and `Account.validate_script`.

## Installation and Setup

Install with `pip install bookchain`. If you want to use the async version,
instead install with `pip install bookchain[asyncql]`.

Once installed, use the following to setup your project as appropriate:

```python
import bookchain

bookchain.publish_migrations(folder_for_migration_files)

bookchain.automigrate(folder_for_migration_files, db_file_path)

bookchain.set_connection_info(db_file_path)
```

To use the async version:

```python
import bookchain
import bookchain.asyncql

bookchain.publish_migrations(folder_for_migration_files)

bookchain.automigrate(folder_for_migration_files, db_file_path)

bookchain.asyncql.set_connection_info(db_file_path)
```

## Tests

There are a total of 10 tests (6 e2e tests and 4 unit tests for miscellaneous
tools/features). To run them, clone the repo, set up a virtual environment
(e.g. `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`), install the
dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and then run the following:
`find tests -name test_*.py -print -exec python {} \;`. On Windows, the 7 test
files will have to be individually run with the following:

```bash
python tests/test_advanced_e2e.py
python tests/test_async_advanced_e2e.py
python tests/test_async_basic_e2e.py
python tests/test_async_correspondences_e2e.py
python tests/test_basic_e2e.py
python tests/test_correspondences_e2e.py
python tests/test_misc.py
```
